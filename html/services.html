                   <p>Antibiotic intravenous infusion therapy is a common therapy in hospitals and it has become more popular in recent years, parallel to the increase in bacterial resistance to many common antibiotics that are administered orally.

                   <p>
                    A bone density test determines if you have osteoporosis — a disorder characterized by bones that are more fragile and more likely to break.  In the past, osteoporosis would be suspected only after you broke a bone. By that time, however, your bones could be quite weak. A bone density test enhances the accuracy of calculating your risk of breaking bones.

                   <p>
                    Botox is effective for the relief of furrows in the forehead, frown lines, lines, and grooves over the bridge of the nose and crow’s feet next to the outer corners of the eyes that become apparent when smiling or frowning. Not only do these muscles cause the face to appear wrinkled, but also they can cause tension headaches. The William Bee Ririe Clinic offers cosmetic and therapeutic Botox
